When I migrated to Linux I was disappointed that I could not find the Monitorian utility I used on Windows to change the brightness of monitors. This forced me to create a similar one. 

Still in developmet...
Works only with secondary monitor. (On my settup analag monitor is detected as primary, but I use it as secondary)
